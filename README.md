# edly-team
This repository is a central Hub for all issues related to Edly - Custom Solutions and its various clients.

Currently, there are multiple teams inside Custom Solutions. For that reason, it is recommended to add a team name label alongside each issue to clarify which team it belongs to.

Another convention we usually follow is writing the name of the Client/Project in Square brackets at the start of the issue Title for clarification purposes. If the task does not belong to any Client/Project, it is recommended to add General instead.

If there are issues created in another GitHub and they are assigned to someone in the Custom Solutions team, they can be imported into the Custom Solutions project by copying the link to the issue and pasting it in the add new issue section on the Project Board.
